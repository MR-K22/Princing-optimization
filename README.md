# Pricing Strategy Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of pricing strategies using real sales and competition data. The project explores pricing data, sales performance, and comparisons between store pricing and competition pricing to derive insights for optimal pricing decisions.

## Project Overview

The core focus of this project is to analyze pricing data with respect to sales amount and quantity sold to evaluate competitive positioning. This includes:
- Exploratory data analysis of sales and pricing for both "Your Store" and competition.
- Visualization of price distributions and sales relationships.
- Sales amount aggregation by price brackets for detailed revenue comparison.
- Regression modeling and dynamic pricing strategies to optimize sales revenue.

## Contents

- `Pricing-Strategy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, data processing steps, visualizations, and modeling.
- Data files (assumed to be stored separately and loaded within the notebook).

## Features

- Load and clean sales and pricing data.
- Visualize price distributions and sales performance.
- Compare sales amounts by price brackets between your store and competitors.
- Implement and evaluate dynamic pricing models.
- Provide actionable insights for pricing decision-making.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with essential libraries:
   ```
   pandas
   matplotlib
   numpy
   
   ```
3. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Create requirements.txt with the above libraries if it does not exist)*

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Pricing-Strategy.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the notebook cells step-by-step to execute the full analysis.
3. Modify or extend the notebook to adapt for new data or additional experiments.

## Data

The analysis assumes access to sales and competition pricing data with columns such as:
- FiscalWeekID
- StoreID
- ItemID
- Price
- ItemQuantity
- SalesAmountNoDiscount
- SalesAmount
- CompetitionPrice

## Results

- Visualizations of sales and pricing distributions.
- Sales performance benchmarks against competition by price segments.
- Dynamic pricing simulation and revenue optimization insights.
